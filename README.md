A bespoke Discord bot with a generic name. This bot is a work in progress and is not intended for general public use. It's mostly a project for me to learn/practice various technologies e.g. Rust and Discord bot development. It is not intended to be a general purpose bot, but rather a bot that is tailored to the needs of the Chaos Crew Discord server. 

## Features
- Slash commands
- Automate moderation and admin tasks
- Reaction roles
- Member reporting system
